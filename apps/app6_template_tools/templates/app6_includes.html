<h1>Template includes</h1>

<p>Includes are NOT the main way for template reuse in Django. You should use template inheritance first.</p>

<p>Includes are only used when you got a small piece of HTML that you know you will need several times, but not that often.</p>

<p>It works the way you expect :</p>

<pre>
&lt;div&gt;
    { % include 'app6_included.html' % }
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    { % include 'app6_included.html' % }
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

will produce:

<div>
    {% include 'app6_included.html' %}
</div>

<div>
    {% include 'app6_included.html' %}
</div>

<p>WARNING: the included template and the including template are rendered separatly, THEN merged. This means you can't access variables from one in another. If you need to do so, use <code>with</code> :</p>

<code>{ % include 'app6_included.html' with variable=value % }</code>

<p>Includes and inheritance can be used together without any problem.</p>
