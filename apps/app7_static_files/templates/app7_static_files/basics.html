    You need to load the static lib before using the 'static' tag.

    'django.contrib.staticfiles' should also be in settings.INSTALLED_APPS.

{% load static %}

        The 'static' tag takes a relative path to a static file (any JS, CSS,
        image, etc) and ouput an absolute path.

        In it's simple form, just put all you files in a directory named
        'static' in each app and give a relative path to this file FROM
        that directory.

        In developpement mode (when running ./manage.py runserver), all the
        files in all the 'static' directories in all apps are discovered and
        served automatically.

        Just like with template, you can create directories and subdirectories
        to organize you files.

        E.G: you could put this in app7_static_file/css/style.css.

        Just like with templates, another app can override the static files
        from this app by using the same path and name.

        One last thing : the default absolute URL prefix for every static file
        is the one specified in settings.STATIC_URL, which default to
        '/static/'. This explains why {% static 'css/app7_style.css' %}
        will result in /static/css/app7_style.css.
