<h1>Links</h1>


<p>This is the same as the previous app, but we generate them dynamically. Try these links:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        {# We use the variable from views.py #}
        <a href="{{ first_link }}"><strong>{{ first_link }}</strong></a>
    </li>

    <li>
        {% comment %}
            This, is what is called a "template tag" in Django's terminology. It's like a fonction,
             but that you can use in a template. It needs to be written between {% %} and not
             {{ }} like variables. Parameters are listed on the right, separated by spaces, not
             comas like in regular functions.

             The "url" tag take a route name (and optionally, urls parameters) and
             return the proper URL, based on urls.py.
        {% endcomment %}
        <a href="{% url 'hello' %}"><strong>{% url 'hello' %}</strong></a>
    </li>

    <li>
        {% comment %}
            {% url include %} would produce an error saying it can't
            find the proper route.
        {% endcomment %}
        <strong>This doesn't work.</strong>
    </li>

    <li>
        {% comment %}
            The URL pattern expect a name ((?P<name>\w+)/$), so we provide
             one as a parameter.
        {% endcomment %}
        <a href="{% url 'hello_name' 'world' %}">
            <strong>{% url 'hello_name' 'world' %}</strong>
        </a>
    </li>

    <li>
        {% comment %}
             You can use the "as" keyword to stuff the returned values from the "url" tag into
             a variable. This allows you to reuse the result instead of calling the tag several
             times like above.

             Note that "as" doesn't work with all tags.
        {% endcomment %}
        {% url 'hello_name' 'You' as hello_link %}
        <a href="{{ hello_link }}">
            <strong>{{ hello_link }}</strong>
        </a>
    </li>

    <li>
        {% comment %}
             By the way, you can pass the parameters using their name,
            just like with function. It ignores the parameter orders
        {% endcomment %}
        {% url 'hello_prefix' prefix='Hey' name='You' as prefixed_link %}
        <a href="{{ prefixed_link }}">
            <strong>{{ prefixed_link }}</strong>
        </a>
    </li>

</ul>

<p>Generating dynamically links ensure you can change views, urls or entire apps much more easily.</p>
